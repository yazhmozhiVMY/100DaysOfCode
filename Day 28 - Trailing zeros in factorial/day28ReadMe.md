### Count trailing zeros in factorial of a number
### Level - easy (Leetcode)
Given an integer n, write a function that returns count of trailing zeroes in n!. 

Examples : 

Input: n = 5
Output: 1 
Explanation: Factorial of 5 is 120 which has one trailing 0.


Input: n = 20
Output: 4
Explanation: Factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000 which has 4 trailing zeroes.


Input: n = 100
Output: 24
### Constraints:

**0 <= n <= 104**
 
### Follow up: 
Could you write a solution that works in **logarithmic time complexity?**
